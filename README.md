# Cache_Block_replacement_simulator

The project simulates a cache memory, more precisely the memory blocks replacement method using a specific algorithm: random, LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First In, First Out). 

When you run the main project, a user interface will appear. Using this interface you can select the cache size, the number of sets, the replacement policy. In the empty box (Multi-tasking in Decimal) you can insert data in decimal, data that will be used by the simulator as addresses. 

The button Show Cache, when pressed, will display in the right side of the interface the addresses arranged in blocks and sets. 

The button Help, when pressed, will open the following page: a href "http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/koren/architecture/Cache/frame1.htm
